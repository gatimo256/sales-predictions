# Sales Pedictions

Using Machine Learning models like linear Regression and  to make Item Sales predictions and based on item and outlet features

# An overview of the project

This sales prediction spans 5 parts in 2 notebooks with data cleaning, data visualization and machine learning models like linear regression and random forest which were used to predict the sales.

# Relevant insights from the data.

The heatmap below shows that there is a moderate correlation between Item Outlet Sales and Item Maximum Retail Price (Item_MRP). Most of the features have very low correlation with the Item Outlet Sales that we are trying to predict.

# Summary of the model and its evaluation metrics

Having sampled different models, the best choice appears to be Random Forest Model for prediction. After evaluating the model using the R^2 score,the model can explain 55% of the variation in the test data.
